## Tools
Soldering iron kit http://amzn.to/2mC21CQ

Hot Glue gun http://amzn.to/2ngUxbL

Dremel type multi-tool http://amzn.to/2ngYbT2

## Method
I've added a Pi Zero, Pi Camera and RGB LED to the drone. everything on the drone is powered from the original drone LIPO battery.

I know a little bit of programming, a little pi, a little electronics and I've put it all together in this project - soldering has been a great skill to learn. It's been a heck of a lot of fun and I'm still working on it. I'd love to hear more from anyone with tips or code comments.
