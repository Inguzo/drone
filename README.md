BOM

Pi Zero W
Pi Camera v1.2
Monkmakes RGB LED (aka the squid)

Method
I've added a Pi Zero, Pi Camera and RGB LED to the drone. everything on the drone is powered from the original drone LIPO battery.

I know a little bit of programming, a little pi, a little electronics and I've put it all together in this project - soldering has been a great skill to learn. It's been a heck of a lot of fun and I'm still working on it. I'd love to hear more from anyone with tips or code comments.
